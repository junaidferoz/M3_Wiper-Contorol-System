# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM
## ___Introduction___
* A windscreen wiper, or a windshield wiper blades are a device used to keep the windscreen or the windshield of a vehuicle clear from any sort of dirt, 
water, dust, sand, etc. that blocks the vision of the driver driving the vehicle.
* This part of the vehicle is an important part of the vehicle as it helps in maintaining clear view of what is in front of the vehicle. <br>
### How do they work?
1. In one of the earliest inventions of a windshield wiper by mary anderson, it was operated via a lever from inside a vehicle. This version of windscreen wipers closely 
resembles the windscreen wiper found on many early car models.
2. Wipers may be powered by a variety of means, although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components, 
typically two 4-bar linkages in series or parallel.
3. Early wipers were often driven by a vacuum motor powered by manifold vacuum. This had the drawback that manifold vacuum varies depending on throttle position, 
and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop. That problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum 
booster pump. <br>

### about STM32
* The STM32F4DISCOVERY Discovery kit uses the capabilities of the STM32F407 high-performance microcontrollers, to allow users to develop any sort of applications with ease. It includes an ST-LINK/V2-A embedded debug tool, one ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, one digital microphone, one audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, push-buttons, and a USB OTG Micro-AB connector.
* It uses ARM architecture
